Test Cases for climate change

1) As we can see that from the year 1984 to 2008 the CO2 concentration level has been increased from 340.17 to 388.5 and average increase is 363.2267532467532.

2) As we can see that from the year 1984 to 2008 the CH4 concentration level has been increased from 1629.89 to 1814.18 and average increase is 1749.824512987013.

3) As we can see that from the year 1984 to 2008 the N2O concentration level has been increased from 303.677 to 322.182 and average increase is 312.3918344155844.

4) As we can see that from the year 1984 to 2008 the CFC-11 concentration level has been increased from 191.324 to 271.494 and average increase is 251.97306818181815.

5) As we can see that from the year 1984 to 2008 the Aerosols concentration level has been increased from 0.0016 to 0.1494 and average increase is 0.016657142857142863.

6) The data from 1984 to 2008 shows a concerning upward trend in various greenhouse gases, indicating ongoing human impact on climate change. The increases in CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, and aerosols highlight the urgent need for global action to mitigate emissions through policy changes, technological advancements, and sustainable practices.
